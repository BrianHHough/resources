OTHER_DETAILS : One of the users of Nuo is claiming that on Nuo.network, the platform was generating a transaction for which the destination address was "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000". Our testing and tech team were unable to recreate this scenario on our platform. We would like to open this up for everyone to try and recreate this for a sizeable bug bounty. Here are the steps to try and re-create this issue: Step 1: Login to app.nuo.network. Step 2: Click on "Nuo Balance" on the top right. Step 3: Click on "Deposit With Metamask". Step 4: Select token and enter an amount which you want to deposit into Nuo and select "Deposit With Metamask". Check if the destination address generated is ever "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000".
